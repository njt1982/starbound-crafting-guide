# Starbound Crafting Guide

**WIP**

1) Unpack your assets

OSX :
* `cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Starbound/`
* `./osx/asset_unpacker assets/packed.pak  ~/Desktop/starbound`

2) From the repo folder, run this command: `./parser.js ~/Desktop/starbound/` (where the 2nd param is the path to your unpacked assets).

This will update `guide.js`
